# Anime==Me
A website created with the purpose of finding like-minded people of the anime community also as a short refrence to new people whom may want to get into anime. I simply share my suggestions for people who are new and to people who may have seen a little bit but would like to find something more to watch.

## Home Page
 Arriving to the page reveals a wide space of decorative pictures to portray the emotions of being in an anime community. Pictures for some to remember and for others to enjoy the art.

 #### logo
 The logo sits to the side as to not impede the view of the pictures while maintaining a viewers normal reading orientation.

 #### navigation links
 connecting to the recommendations section of the page is the navigation links to blend in with the borderline as well as to find an easy navigation point. While the links grow in size to let the viewers understand which link they are about to press.

 #### Reccomendations
 Broken into 3 pieces we see the recommendations. With specific coloring for its purpose:<br>
<ul>
<li>The new section for people to first dive into anime for a good experience.
<li>People who are not entiely new but still do not know what will be a good next step in their journey.
<li>Anime that are not so well known or well watched that are enjoyable.
</ul>
